Useful resources in view of the work "Mutual linearity of nonequilibrium network currents" ([arXiv:2402.13193](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13193)).


<em>tutorial.nb</em>: Mathematica notebook going through the main ideas and useful functions (spanning tree visualization, rooted trees, deletion-contraction formulas, current-current susceptibility, current bounds). Includes a hands-on section where the user inputs a rate matrix and gets the linearity coefficients.

<em>figures.nb</em>: Mathematica notebook to reproduce the paper figures. Requires the stoichiometric matrices in the .mtx files.
